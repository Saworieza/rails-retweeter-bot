# Rails Retweeter Bot

This is the source of the bot tweeting at [@rails_bot](https://twitter.com/rails_bot). I'm putting it here in case someone wants to reuse it to make another bot, or offer suggestions to tweak @rails_bot.

## The idea

The are a lot of people in the Ruby/Rails community that I'd like to follow. However, in order to read their interesting tweets I'd also have to agree to read all the other things they tweet, and then I wouldn't do anything else than read tweets all day.

Basically, I want to read this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Thanks @<a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">steveklabnik</a> for reminding me about this article. Every programmer should read it: <a href="http://t.co/1CgfnckT" title="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falâ€¦</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove/status/241645297019801602" data-datetime="2012-08-31T21:15:03+00:00">August 31, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But not this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-left" width="350"><p>Just saw a poo that looked like a starfish.</p>&mdash; Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove/status/257938626736971776" data-datetime="2012-10-15T20:18:55+00:00">October 15, 2012</a></blockquote>

(sorry, Aaron...)

What I need is someone that would follow all these people, read all their tweets and retweet only what seems important. This bot is my attempt at creating such filter.

## How it works

The basic idea was that the best tweets get retweeted a lot, so I made the bot select tweets with a high number of retweets. Adding favorites improved things further, because a lot of tweets get many favorites but not many retweets (especially some useful but not funny tweets from [@ruby_news](https://twitter.com/ruby_news) or [@rubyflow](https://twitter.com/rubyflow) - the funny ones get retweeted the most). I've ignored retweets because almost all of them were off topic.

Now I had most of the interesting tweets marked to be retweeted, but most of the top tweets were still not relevant - funny tweets about random things, tweets about politics, current news, Apple, Microsoft, startups, religion, etc. So then I've added a keyword whitelist - I went through the top tweets and I've prepared a list of keywords that would only match the tweets I'd like to see retweeted.

I've also made the minimum number of retweets+favorites depend on the author - those with a high number of followers get much more retweets on average, so a post with 30 retweets by [@spastorino](https://twitter.com/spastorino) (3871 followers) will usually be more interesting than a post with 30 retweets by [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh) (72141 followers).

The end result is that even though some good tweets are ignored and some off topic tweets get retweeted, the filter works surprisingly well in most cases. It should retweet about 4 tweets per day on average, which sounds like an acceptable number.

## How to use 

Obviously, start with `bundle install`.

Create a `config.yml` file based on the example file. Sign up for an app on Twitter and copy the first two keys to the config. Then use the `oauth_generator.rb` script to get the other two keys (sign in with the account that will be retweeting!).

Then you can use any of these:

### ./bot retweet

Loads 200 last tweets from the timeline (ignoring retweets) and retweets the ones that match the filter and weren't retweeted yet. This means that only tweets from people that the bot is following will be analyzed.

200 last tweets includes tweets from the last 2 days on average (I think most tweets will get most of their retweets and favorites in the first 2 days anyway).

### ./bot fetch data.json

Downloads last 3 months of tweets from each of the followed people and saves them as a JSON file.

### ./bot cached data.json

Starts a web UI that you can use to tweak the filter and see which tweets get marked. Uses the JSON file created above.

### ./bot live

Starts a web UI, downloading tweets on demand. This is useful for checking new profiles to see if it's worth adding them to the list.

## How to customize the RetweeterBot

After setting up the app on Twitter, inputting your keys into `config.yml` file and running the ./bots, you can customize your RetweeterBot to focus on specific content you are looking for by changing the keywords and the threshold values for a tweet to be retweeted.

### Edit keywords that will not be retweeted in 'keywords_blacklist.txt'

These are the words that you DO NOT want included in any of your retweets. You can open the document in a text editor and add words that you don't want included or remove any words that were in the initial text file. This enables you to prevent offensive or irrelevent tweets to be retweeted.

### Edit words that will be retweeted in 'keywords_whitelist.txt'

The list of words in the text file are the words that you DO want included in your retweets. You can open the document in a text editor and add words that you want included in your retweets or remove any words that were initially in the text file. The whitelist enables your to identify and retweet relevant tweets. 

### Change retweet threshold in 'tweet_presenter.rb'  

If you look in 'tweet_presenter.rb'and find the 'user_awesomeness_threshold' function, you can customize the threshold values that determine which retweets get retweeted. The way the threshold currently works is if the number of retweets+the number of favorites on a given tweet is greater than or equal to a threshold (which accounts to the number of followers), then that tweet will be retweeted. 
For example, the code could look be: ((user.followers_count)/1000). If the number of followers is 6000 and the number of retweets+favorites is 10, then (6000/1000)<10, so that tweet would be exceed the threshold and be retweeted.
